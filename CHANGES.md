* Addition of `orbprofile` for ETM profiling and integration with {k/q}cachegrind, see https://github.com/KDE/kcachegrind.
* Addition of `orbmortem` for ETM/ETB post-mortem analysis.

3rd June 2022 (Version 1.13)

* Fix -v missing parameter
* Allow orbcat sockets to reconnect on loss of connection
* Add SAM5X SWO support
* Prevent segfault in orbtop when elf changes
* Fix assert when fpga has no data to deliver
* Add pyocd to list of trace sources

* Compatability with languages other than C family (specifically Rust)

23rd October 2020 (Version 1.10)

* Replace `master` with `main`.
* Single entry into a channel definition can be expanded multiple times (up to 4), so -c,z,"[%02x] %c" would print both a hex and ascii representation of a character, for example
* Link Monitoring and reporting (enabled with the `-m` option to orbuculum.
* Simple colour support (disable by commenting out `SCREEN_HANDLING` in the makefile).
* Internal restructuring to simplify the packet decode. This will help you if you want to implement your own handlers. See `orbcat.c` for a simple example, or `orbtop.c` if timestamp ordering is important to you.
* orbuculum now processes simple ISYNC messages, reporting them as type 8 in the hwevent fifo.
* ocbcat can now read directly from a file.
* orbcat and orbuculum can both terminate reading from a file when it's exhaused with the `-e` option.
* Addition of JSON output for orbtop
* Interrupt measurements have been added into orbtop
* Per interval status reporting (overflow, sync etc) has been
  added to the orbtop interactive display.
* povray splash screen generator
* Refactoring of fifo code to allow it to be optional in orbuculum.c

9th September 2019 (Version 1.00)
